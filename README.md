# Description
This file contains the information to set up and run the ML models on Benchmarking Hanoi Dataset(https://github.com/KIOS-Research/LeakDB/tree/master/CCWI-WDSA2018/Benchmarks)

# Setup Instructions
- Install the latest version of python 3.10 using your favourite installer

# Setup the Virtual Environment
1. Install conda
2. Create new virtual environment using `conda create --name venv python=3.10`
3. Activate the conda environment using `conda activate venv`
4. Install all the required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt` | 
    - Alternatively you can also run `pip-sync -r requirements.txt` which would delete unncessary packages


# Running the Notebooks
1. To run the notebooks you need to install the Hanoi Dataset from https://github.com/KIOS-Research/LeakDB/tree/master/CCWI-WDSA2018/Benchmarks
2. Unzip the file and store it in your local disk or external hard disk(This is large dataset with size ~25GB)
3. Assign the path of the data folder to the the raw_path variable in the cell no. 2 of the notebook
4. Run the cells in the given order
